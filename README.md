## YueS client for Node.js

Simple low-level library to help to connect and use fast and reliable YueS GUI server.  
Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) without external dependencies.  
Since it's a low-level library, it's meant to be used as a dependency while creating your own high-level GUI libraries. Do not use this library directly in your apps.  
Builds itself using [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev).
